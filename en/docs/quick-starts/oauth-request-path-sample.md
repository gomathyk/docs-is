 **OAuth authenticator**
 
 -   **Authorization Grant Type:** Resource Owner (password grant)
 -   **Client ID:** The client id received at the application registration  
 -   **Client Secret:** The client secret received at the application registration 
 -   **Resource Owner User Name:** User Name
 -   **Resource Owner Password:** Password of the user
 -   **Scope**: `openid`
 
 -   **Access Token Endpoint:**
     `                               https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token                             `
 
!!! info
    Once you receive the access token, you can use the following for authorizing.
    ```https://localhost:9443/oauth2/authorize?access_token=<access_token>```
         

!!! tip "Troubleshooting tip"

	If you are getting the following error, the sample applications do not have a keystore in them.
	Therefore, you may get this error after changing the tomcat hostname because the public key of the WSO2 Identity Server does
	not exist in the Java certificate store.

	``` java
	javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: 			sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
	```
