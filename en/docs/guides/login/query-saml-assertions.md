# Query SAML2 Assertions

This page guides you through querying dynamic or existing SAML2 assertions using standard request messages via WSO2 Identity Server. 

Due to some reason if you can not pass a SAML Assertion to the backend, then you can pass an identifier with the request to query and obtain the assertion from the backend instead.

This guide assumes you have your own application. If you wish to try out this flow with a sample application, click the button below.

## Create a service provider

{!fragments/register-a-service-provider.md!}

----

## SAML Configurations 

1. Expand **Inbound Authentication Configuration > SAML2 Web SSO Configuration** and click **Configure**.

2. Enter the **Issuer**. 

    !!! info
        The **Issuer** is the unique identifier of the service provider. This is also the issuer value specified in the SAML Authentication Request issued by the service provider.
     
2. Enter the **Assertion Consumer URL** and click **Add**.
    
    !!! info
        The **Assertion Consumer URL** is the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL of the service provider. This URL should be the URL of the page to which the browser is redirected to after successful authentication.

4. Select **Enable Assertion Query Request Profile** to enable saml assertions. 

5. Click **Register**.
    
!!! tip
     To configure more advanced configurations, see [Advanced SAML Configurations](../../../guides/login/saml-app-config-advanced). 


## Persist assertions to the database

Optionally, you can use a custom assertion builder that enables persisting assertions in the database for this profile. 

1.  Open the `deployment.toml` file in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf` directory.

2.  Add the following configuration.

    ``` toml
    [saml.extensions] 
    assertion_builder= "org.wso2.carbon.identity.sso.saml.builders.assertion.ExtendedDefaultAssertionBuilder"
    ```

3. Restart the server.

## Query SAML assertions

{!fragments/saml-query-assertion-client-app.md!}

1. Access the application that you configured as a service provider via the assertion consumer URL that you configured above. 

2.  Start the SAML Tracer.

    !!! tip
        If you do not have a SAML tracer already, install a SAML Tracer (plugin/application/browser extension) that enables searching assertions.

3.  Log in using administrator credentials (admin:admin).

    When a user logs in, the created assertion will be persisted in the SAML Tracer.

4. Navigate to the `<CLIENT_HOME>/src/main/java/org/wso2/carbon/identity/saml/query/profile/test` directory.

5. Open the relevant java class of the query type you wish to request (e.g., `SAMLAssertionIDRequestClient.java`).

6. Enter the required values extracted from the assertion, and run the `main()` method of the class. An assertion request will be generated.

7. Note that a request and response get generated according to the given query type.

    !!! tip 
        A sample for each request can be found at the `<CLIENT_HOME>/sample-request-messages` directory.

You have successfully queried an assertion using your application.
