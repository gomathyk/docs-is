# Client Credentials Grant Type

This grant is suitable for machine-to-machine authentication or for a client making requests to an API that does not 
require the user’s permission. This grant should be allowed for use only by trusted [confidential clients](../client-types/#confidential-clients).

---

## How does it work?

The client can request an access token using only its client credentials with this grant type. It is similar to the 
[resource owner password credentials](../resource-owner-grant) grant type except in this case, only the client’s credentials 
are used to authenticate a request for an access token.

The diagram below illustrates the implicit grant flow.

One of the following cURL commands can be used to try this grant type.

!!! abstract ""
    **Request 1**
    ``` java
    curl -v -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic <Base64Encoded(CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET)>" -k -d "grant_type=client_credentials" -H "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" <TOKEN_ENDPOINT>
    ```
    ---
    **Request 2**
    ``` java
    curl -u <CLIENT_ID>:<CLIENT_SECRET> -k -d "grant_type=client_credentials" -H "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" <TOKEN_ENDPOINT>
    ```
    ---
    You will receive a response similiar to the format below.
    ```
    {
        "token_type":"Bearer",
        "expires_in":2061,
        "access_token":"ca19a540f544777860e44e75f605d927"
    }
    ```

!!! info "Support for refresh token grant"
    This grant type doesn't issue a refresh token which can be used to obtain new access tokens using the [refresh token grant](refresh-token-grant.md).
