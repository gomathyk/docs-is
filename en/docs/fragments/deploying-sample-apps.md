### Sample prerequisites

- Download Apache Tomcat 8.x from
[here](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) and install. Tomcat
server installation location will be referred as `<TOMCAT_HOME>` later
in this guide.
        

- It is recommended that you use a hostname that is not
`          localhost         ` to avoid browser errors. Modify the
`          /etc/hosts         ` entry in your machine to reflect this.
Note that `          wso2is.local         ` is used in
this documentation as an example, but you must modify this when
configuring the authenticators or connectors with this sample
application.
